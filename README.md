# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

This project implements a simple image classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Train the model.

4. Evaluate the model.




## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers and fully connected layers. The final layer uses softmax activation to output probabilities for each class.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded and pre-processed by the Keras library.

## Credits

This project is based on the CIFAR-10 dataset and utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
